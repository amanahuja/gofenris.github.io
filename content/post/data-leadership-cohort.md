Fenris is excited to announce a new program on data leadership and governance, in partnership with Aspiration and Digital Public. 

## Call for Participation

As civil society moves to increasingly data-centric and data-driven modes of doing work and making change, we face new challenges in stewarding and governing the assets that underlie and power those efforts.

New types of leaders are emerging to meet these challenges, but few resources are available to inform governance, stewardship and long-term responsible leadership in data-centric missions and ventures.

**Aspiration, Digital Public, and Fenris are announcing the Data Leadership Cohort (DLC), an opportunity for these leaders to meet, learn, and build networks with each other.**

This is a small-group format for a practice-oriented peer learning group of 8-12 individuals. Over the course of 8 weeks, the group will prototype structures and processes for effective data governance by workshopping each otherâ€™s real-world cases. 

We are recruiting an initial cohort now for launch in early 2022. If the first cohort is successful, and based on level of interest, we may consider additional cohorts. We will also provide other ways to engage and to share insights and learnings from the DLC.
