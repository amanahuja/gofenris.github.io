In 2022, Fenris, along with Aspiration and Digital Public, launched a new program on data leadership and governance. The Data Leadership Cohort was designed to create opportunities for leaders to learn from peers about governance, stewardship and long-term responsible leadership in data-centric missions and ventures. 

The first cohort brought together a group of brilliant leaders through Aspiration's co-learning framework, centered on a series of practice-oriented sessions over three months. In the sessions, the group prototyped structures and processes for effective data governance by workshopping each otherâ€™s real-world cases. 

## The 2022 DLC cohort 

The leaders partipating in the inaugural data leadership cohort were: 
* **Jessica Davison** -- Director of Learning, Analytics and Compliance, United Way of Greater Houston
