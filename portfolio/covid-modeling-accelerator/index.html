Fenris team members worked with candidates to help develop objectives and milestones, and to create a proposal in less than a month. Proposals were reviewed by SMDM, and the funds were administered via a vendor contract from Johns Hopkins University. Guidance was provided by the steering committee, which included members from RF, SMDM, and Fenris. The committee also helped determine allocation of technical assistance to the awardees.</p><p>The data modeling teams are multi-disciplinary teams composed of epidemiologists, numerical modelers, and experts in public health, operations research, and related fields. More information is available about the awardees of the COVID Modeling Accelerator on the SMDM website at <a href=https://nursing.jhu.edu/cma>https://nursing.jhu.edu/cma</a>. We thank these teams for the opportunity to work with them and learn from them.</p><p>You can read <a href=https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/news/the-rockefeller-foundation-launches-covid-19-modeling-accelerator/>Rockefeller Foundation&rsquo;s announcement</a> of this initiative for more information.</p></div></article></div><article class="pa3 pa4-ns nested-copy-line-height nested-img"><section class="cf ph3 ph5-l pv3 pv4-l f2 tc-l center measure-wide lh-copy">Partners</section><aside class="flex-ns flex-wrap justify-around mt2"><div class="relative mw6 mb4 bg-fa-blue ba b--black-10 fa-light-gray br3"><div class="cf ph3 ph5-l pv3 pv4-l f4 tc-l center measure-wide lh-copy"><h1 class="f4 mb2">Rockefeller Foundation (RF)</h1><p class="f6 fw4 mt0">Funder, Strategy, Steering Committee</p><p class="f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The Rockefeller Foundation advances new frontiers of science, data, and innovation to solve global challenges related to health, food, power, and economic mobility.
