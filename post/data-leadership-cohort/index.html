Over the course of 8 weeks, the group will prototype structures and processes for effective data governance by workshopping each other’s real-world cases.</p><p>We are recruiting an initial cohort now for launch in early 2022. If the first cohort is successful, and based on level of interest, we may consider additional cohorts. We will also provide other ways to engage and to share insights and learnings from the DLC.</p><p>We invite you to express interest in participation in the first cohort, future cohorts, or in general by completing the questionnaire below.</p><h2 id=who-we-are-hoping-to-work-with>Who we are hoping to work with</h2><p>The Data Leadership Cohort (DLC) welcomes expressions of interest from anyone for whom one or more of the following questions apply and resonate:</p><ul><li>Do you have direct oversight or management responsibility for large, sensitive or complicated data resources?</li><li>Are you trying to design a digital platform, digitally transform a public service, or balance complex interests in managing the use of data?</li><li>Are you wrestling with a complicated data governance issue, addressing threats and challenges, and/or working to establish equitable and forward-looking practices for stewarding your data assets?</li><li>Do you lack the expertise or support infrastructure to feel sure about what you’re doing?</li><li>Do you want to speak and learn from others facing similar or related challenges?</li></ul><p>Many people with complementary skills and experience are facing these same challenges, and we think that you can help each other.</p><p>Through participating, participants will gain a deeper understanding of data governance in a practical sense and get help, expertise, and support from a group of similarly situated practitioners.</p><p><strong>What we are not looking to work with at this time:</strong> We may broaden the DLC in the future to include researchers, intermediaries and other stakeholders, but in this phase we are seeking participation from directly responsible parties.</p><h3 id=the-dlc-program>The DLC Program</h3><p>The Data Leadership Cohort brings together Aspiration’s field-leading and tested frameworks for peer learning, Digital Public’s expertise in public interest data governance, and practical expertise from Fenris for integrating these ideas into team, process and product.</p><p>The first cohort will consist of 12 virtual sessions of 90-minute each. Sessions will be calendared once the range of participant time zones is known.</p><p>For those applicants who are not selected or cannot participate in the first cohort, we still encourage you to fill out the questionnaire and express your interest.</p><h3 id=how-to-express-interest>How to express interest</h3><p>To express interest, visit the website below and follow the application guidelines before December 15 2021.</p><p>Participants for each cohort will be selected to maximize learning opportunities &ndash; selecting for shared challenge, complementary skill sets and level of experience, and a plurality of roles and perspectives. We will also consider practical constraints such as availability and time zones.</p><h2 id=about-the-organizers>About the Organizers</h2><p><a href=https://aspirationtech.org/>Aspiration</a> connects nonprofit organizations, free and open source projects, philanthropic funders and activists with strategic frameworks, technology solutions, data skills that help them realize their missions.</p><p><a href=https://www.digitalpublic.io/>Digital Public</a> is a public interest data governance firm.
