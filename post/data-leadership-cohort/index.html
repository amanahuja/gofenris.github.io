Announcing the Data Leadership Cohort, a peer learning program from Aspiration, Digital Public, and Fenris Network</p><p>Aspiration, Digital Public, and Fenris Network are producing an opportunity for these leaders to meet, learn, and build networks with each other, utilizing a co-learning framework refined over the last 10 years.</p><p>We’re recruiting an initial cohort for a practice-oriented data governance peer learning group. Over the course of 8 weeks, a group of 8-12 data governance practitioners will focus on specific design components and requirements for effective data governance by workshopping each others’ real-world cases.</p><h3 id=who-should-join-this-cohort>Who should join this cohort?</h3><p>You’re making a decision about how to design a digital platform, a public service (and/or procurement), or a public interest data sharing project. Your primary goal is to gain a deeper understanding of data governance in a broad, practical sense and, secondarily, to get the help, expertise, and support from a group of similarly situated practitioners.</p><p>Who we are not looking to work with at this time: This is not a call for those who are near to or interested in data governance, but don’t have a specific, direct, applied context in which they are making decisions about how one of the above contexts is implemented. We hope to ultimately broaden this program to include researchers, intermediaries and other stakeholders, but are focusing on directly responsible parties in this first phase.</p><h3 id=how-do-i-join>How do I join?</h3><p>If you would like to participate in the Data Leadership Cohort, let us know before <strong>January 31st 2022</strong> by filling out the CfP form. A link will be posted here.</p><p>We will be selecting participants to maximize learning opportunities, identifying for shared challenges, complementary skill sets and compatible levels of experience, and a plurality of roles and perspectives. We will also consider practical constraints such as availability and time zones.</p><p>The program will consist of 12 virtual sessions of 90-minute each, held every Tuesday. Sessions will be scheduled based on group availability.</p><h3 id=what-if-i-cannot-participate>What if I cannot participate?</h3><p>This is an experiment for us, bringing together Aspiration’s field-leading and tested frameworks for peer learning, Digital Public’s expertise in public interest data governance, and Fenris’ experience in supporting similar teams. If successful, and based on level of interest, additional cohorts may be offered in the future.</p><p>For those applicants who are not selected or cannot participate in the first cohort, we still encourage you to fill out the questionnaire and express your interest. We will provide an opportunity to opt-in to other ways to engage and to receive insights and learnings from the cohorts.</p><h2 id=about-the-organizers>About the Organizers</h2><p><a href=https://aspirationtech.org/>Aspiration</a> connects nonprofit organizations, free and open source projects, philanthropic funders and activists with strategic frameworks, technology solutions, data skills that help them realize their missions.</p><p><a href=https://www.digitalpublic.io/>Digital Public</a> is a public interest data governance firm.
